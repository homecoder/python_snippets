# Python Snippets
A collection of python snippets which I deem to be useful, useless, interesting, brilliant or mind-boggling terrible.

*note*: I have snippets everywhere but in one organized place, many I wrote myself, ranging from the aforementioned "mind-boggling terrible" to, well ill go with useful or interesting. I will pick a different location here and there (i.e. backup drive #4) and see what I can find.

## Categories

Not quite there yet.  But I will do my best to categorize them.

## Contributions

I would absolutely adore pull requests with some contributions!

## License

Since I can't claim to be the author of all snippets; some may have come from forums, stack overflow, etc you will have to review the information on each snippet, or snippet foler.

All of my personal works will have a license associated with it (the vast majority will be MIT) either in the file, or in the folder should the snippet need multiple files.

## Content Removal

I have done my best to credit the original author by way of link to the source, but in some cases I spaced out, I do have Adult ADHD and shiny objects have found their way in front of my at the most inopportune time.

That being said; if I happen to post works of yours and you would either like Credit, or removal, please create an issue with appropriate evidence and I will have it addressed post-haste.
